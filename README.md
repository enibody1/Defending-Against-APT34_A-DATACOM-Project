# Defending-Against-APT34_A-DATACOM-Project 🛡️

This repository contains a cybersecurity research project focused on **Advanced Persistent Threat Group 34 (APT34)**, also known as **OilRig**. Leveraging Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools and the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**, the goal is to develop an effective defense strategy to help organizations identify and protect against potential threats from this threat actor.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To analyze APT34’s history, motives, and tactics, and to propose practical security measures based on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. The findings aim to inform and guide a client leadership team on how to improve their organization’s cybersecurity posture.

## 📌 Key Research Questions

1. What is the history of APT34?
2. Which nation/state are they associated with?
3. Do they target specific industries?
4. What are their motives?
5. What Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) do they use?
6. What security measures can organizations implement to defend against APT34?

## 🛡️ MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

APT34's TTPs were analyzed and mapped to the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

- **Initial Access**: Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001)
- **Execution**: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)
- **Persistence**: Registry Run Keys (T1547.001)
- **Credential Access**: Credential Dumping (T1003)
- **Exfiltration**: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)

## ✅ Key Recommendations

- Implement regular **patch management**
- Provide **phishing awareness training** to employees
- Enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
- Deploy **endpoint detection and response (EDR)**
- Utilize **network segmentation**
- Maintain an effective **incident response plan**

## 📈 Outcome

This project demonstrates the use of industry-standard frameworks and open-source tools to investigate and defend against state-sponsored cyber threats. It serves as a practical example of how OSINT and threat intelligence can be used to enhance an organization’s security strategy.
